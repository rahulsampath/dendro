DENDRO v1.0
-------------------------
The instructions for installing the library can be found in the
INSTALL file. 

'DENDRO' is a collection of tools for parallel octree-based
applications. It is written in C++ using the standard template library
(STL) and uses the Message Passing standard, MPI. It supports the
PETSc objects 'Mat' and 'Vec' and provides interfaces to PETSc's
linear and non-linear solvers. DENDRO is released under the GNU Public
License, a copy of which can be found in the file LICENCE.GPL


The DENDRO library comprises of 4 main modules, which are listed below: 
1. 'par': A templated library of parallel functions used for sorting, 
          merging, searching and partitioning data.  
2. 'oct': Functions used to construct and balance linear 
          octrees.  
3. 'oda': Functions used to construct and manage the 
          Finite element mesh and provides interfaces to create the PETSc objects 
          'Mat' and 'Vec'.  
4. 'omg': Functions used to set up and use the multigrid 
          solver on the octree based finite element discretization.
